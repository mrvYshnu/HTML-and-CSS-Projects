# HTML and CSS Projects

This repository contains all coursework and projects completed during my HTML and CSS course.

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Practice using HTML and CSS to build web pages
- Track my progress throughout the course
- Demonstrate version control skills using Git and GitHub
- Build a portfolio of projects for future reference and job applications
All work for this course will be completed locally and pushed to this GitHub repository on a regular basis.
